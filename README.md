> **Your markdown is your database. `sbdb` makes it act like one.**

A file-backed knowledge base ORM with typed schemas, Starlark virtual fields, integrity signing, a knowledge graph, semantic search, and an immutable append-only event log. Single static binary. Plain files on disk. No database server. No lock-in. Designed as a stable JSON CLI so AI agents can read and write your knowledge base without breaking it.

### Who will love this tool

- **Engineering teams** managing ADRs, runbooks, design docs, and incident reports who want their content to be enforceable data — with tamper detection, structured queries, and semantic search instead of "grep and pray"
- **AI-agent builders** who need a stable JSON CLI their agent can drive safely, plus an audit trail that records every change the agent makes (so reviewers can see exactly what got touched)
- **Obsidian / VitePress / Docusaurus / MkDocs users** who already love markdown and want to add typed schemas, integrity verification, fast queries, and a real knowledge graph on top of what they have
- **Compliance- and audit-conscious teams** who need an immutable, cryptographically verifiable record of every change to a knowledge base — without standing up a separate audit-log service
- **Personal "second brain" practitioners** who want one static binary, no cloud, no subscription, no SaaS, full local ownership of their data
- **Platform teams** building event-driven systems on top of knowledge — every mutation emits a JSONL event ready to fan out to SNS, SQS, Kafka, or webhooks via `git pull` + tail, no markdown re-parsing required

## Why this exists

Knowledge lives in markdown files. Teams write ADRs, meeting notes, guides, and architecture docs as `.md` files with YAML frontmatter, then serve them through VitePress, Docusaurus, Obsidian, or Jekyll. This works until it doesn't.

The problems start quietly. A frontmatter field says `status: active` but the YAML index says `status: draft`. Someone edits a file by hand and breaks the frontmatter format. A new team member creates a discussion note in the wrong directory. An AI agent rewrites a doc and silently drops three metadata fields. Six months in, nobody trusts the data, searches return stale results, and the knowledge base has become a knowledge graveyard.

The root cause is that **markdown files are treated as dumb text when they're actually structured data**. They have schemas (frontmatter fields), relationships (links between docs), computed properties (title from heading, word count, ticket references), and lifecycle states (draft, active, archived). But nothing enforces this structure. Nothing detects when it breaks. Nothing connects the dots between documents.

`secondbrain-db` exists because knowledge bases deserve the same guarantees that databases take for granted:

- **Schema validation** — a note with `status: invalid` is rejected, not silently accepted
- **Integrity signing** — every file is hashed; hand-edits are detected, not lost in the noise
- **Computed fields** — the title is extracted from the `# heading` once, not maintained by hand in two places
- **Queryable indexes** — filtering 1,000 records reads one YAML file, not 1,000 markdown files
- **Relationship tracking** — when doc A links to doc B, that relationship is a first-class edge in a knowledge graph, not a string buried in prose
- **Two-tier tracking** — structured entities get full ORM treatment; unstructured pages (templates, index pages, guides) still get integrity signing and graph inclusion
- **Audit trail** — git is the audit trail. `sbdb events emit <commit-from> [<commit-to>]` projects git history into a JSONL stream on stdout, ready to pipe downstream (SNS / SQS / Kafka / webhooks). No event files are stored — the projection reads from `git log` on demand

The tool is deliberately a **single static binary** (`sbdb`) that operates on **plain files on disk**. No database server. No lock-in. Your docs stay as markdown files that any tool can read. `sbdb` layers structure, integrity, and intelligence on top — and gets out of the way when you don't need it.

It's also designed as an **API layer for AI agents**. Every command outputs structured JSON. Exit codes are stable and semantic. Schema introspection is self-describing. A Claude Code plugin ships with integrity hooks that automatically detect and fix drift after every edit. The premise is simple: if an AI is going to help maintain your knowledge base, the knowledge base needs to be able to tell the AI when something is wrong.

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/sergio-bershadsky/secondbrain-db@latest
```

Or download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sergio-bershadsky/secondbrain-db/releases).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Initialize a project
sbdb init

# Create a document
echo '{"id":"hello","created":"2026-04-08","status":"active","content":"# Hello World\n\nMy first note."}' | sbdb create -s notes --input -

# Query
sbdb query -s notes --filter status=active --format json

# Get by ID
sbdb get -s notes --id hello --format json

# Check consistency
sbdb doctor check -s notes

# Update
sbdb update -s notes --id hello --field status=archived

# Delete
sbdb delete -s notes --id hello --yes
```

## Schema format

Schemas live in `schemas/*.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
entity: notes
docs_dir: docs/notes
filename: "{id}.md"
id_field: id
integrity: strict

fields:
  id:      { type: string, required: true }
  created: { type: date, required: true }
  status:  { type: enum, values: [active, archived], default: active }
  tags:    { type: list, items: { type: string } }

virtuals:
  title:
    returns: string
    source: |
      def compute(content, fields):
          for line in content.splitlines():
              if line.startswith("# "):
                  return line.removeprefix("# ").strip()
          return fields["id"]
```

## Tutorial: building a custom schema from scratch

The real power of `sbdb` is defining your own schemas for any entity type you need. This tutorial walks through creating a **recipe book** knowledge base end-to-end.

Reference schemas for common entity types (notes, ADRs, discussions, tasks, blog posts) are available in the secondbrain-db Claude Code plugin under `skills/secondbrain-db/reference/schemas/` — copy one to get started quickly, or write your own from scratch.

### Step 1: Initialize a project

Start with a fresh directory. `sbdb init` creates the folder structure and a starter config.

```bash
mkdir my-recipes && cd my-recipes
sbdb init
```

This creates:

```
my-recipes/
├── .sbdb.toml          # project config
├── schemas/            # add your schema YAML files here
└── docs/               # markdown files live here
```

### Step 2: Design your schema

Think about what fields your entity needs. For recipes:

- **Scalar fields** (queryable from frontmatter): `slug`, `created`, `cuisine`, `difficulty`, `prep_time`
- **Complex fields** (frontmatter only): `ingredients` (list of objects), `tags`
- **Virtual fields** (computed from content): `title`, `step_count`

Create `schemas/recipes.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
entity: recipes
docs_dir: docs/recipes
filename: "{slug}.md"
id_field: slug
integrity: strict

fields:
  slug:       { type: string, required: true }
  created:    { type: date, required: true }
  cuisine:    { type: string, required: true }
  difficulty: { type: enum, values: [easy, medium, hard], default: easy }
  prep_time:  { type: int }
  tags:       { type: list, items: { type: string } }
  ingredients:
    type: list
    items:
      type: object
      fields:
        name:     { type: string, required: true }
        amount:   { type: string, required: true }
        unit:     { type: string }
```

Each field declaration follows this format:

```yaml
field_name: { type: <type>, required: <bool>, default: <value> }
```

Supported types: `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `date`, `datetime`, `enum`, `list`, `object`.

### Step 3: Add virtual fields

Virtual fields are Starlark functions that extract or compute values from the markdown body. Add them to your schema:

```yaml
# append to schemas/recipes.yaml

virtuals:
  title:
    returns: string
    source: |
      def compute(content, fields):
          for line in content.splitlines():
              if line.startswith("# "):
                  return line.removeprefix("# ").strip()
          return fields["slug"]

  step_count:
    returns: int
    source: |
      def compute(content, fields):
          count = 0
          for line in content.splitlines():
              stripped = line.strip()
              if len(stripped) > 2 and stripped[0].isdigit() and stripped[1] == ".":
                  count += 1
          return count
```

Rules for Starlark virtuals:
- The function must be named `compute` and accept `(content, fields)`
- `content` is the markdown body as a string
- `fields` is a dict of all field values
- `re.findall(pattern, text)` is available for regex
- No file I/O, no imports, no network — fully sandboxed

### Step 4: Update your config

Edit `.sbdb.toml` to point at your new schema:

```toml
schema_dir = "./schemas"
base_path = "."
default_schema = "recipes"

[output]
format = "auto"

[integrity]
key_source = "env"
```

With `default_schema = "recipes"`, you no longer need `-s recipes` on every command.

### Step 5: Verify the schema loads

```bash
# List available schemas
sbdb schema list

# Inspect your schema
sbdb schema show --format json

# Generate JSON Schema (useful for AI agents)
sbdb json-schema
```

`schema show` outputs field classifications (scalar vs complex), virtual field metadata, and all config. This is the self-describing API that agents use to discover your data model.

### Step 6: Create your first document

Option A — from a JSON payload via stdin:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | sbdb create --input -
{
  "slug": "pad-thai",
  "created": "2026-04-08",
  "cuisine": "Thai",
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "prep_time": 30,
  "tags": ["noodles", "stir-fry", "weeknight"],
  "ingredients": [
    {"name": "rice noodles", "amount": "200", "unit": "g"},
    {"name": "shrimp", "amount": "300", "unit": "g"},
    {"name": "fish sauce", "amount": "3", "unit": "tbsp"}
  ],
  "content": "# Pad Thai\n\nClassic Thai stir-fried noodles.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Soak noodles in warm water for 20 minutes\n2. Heat oil in a wok over high heat\n3. Cook shrimp until pink, about 2 minutes\n4. Add noodles and sauce, toss for 3 minutes\n5. Serve with lime wedges and crushed peanuts"
}
EOF
```

Option B — from CLI flags:

```bash
sbdb create \
  --field slug=pasta-aglio \
  --field created=2026-04-08 \
  --field cuisine=Italian \
  --field difficulty=easy \
  --field prep_time=15 \
  --field 'tags=["pasta","garlic","quick"]' \
  --content-file pasta-aglio.md
```

After creating, `sbdb` writes two files side by side in `docs/recipes/`:

```
docs/recipes/pad-thai.md     ← markdown with YAML frontmatter + body
docs/recipes/pad-thai.yaml   ← sidecar: scalar projection + integrity manifest
```

### Step 7: Query your data

Queries hit the sidecar `.yaml` files only — no file I/O per record, fast even for thousands of documents.

```bash
# All recipes
sbdb list

# Filter by cuisine
sbdb query --filter cuisine=Thai

# Filter with lookups
sbdb query --filter difficulty=easy --filter prep_time__lte=20

# Order by prep time, take top 5
sbdb query --order prep_time --limit 5

# Count recipes by difficulty
sbdb query --filter difficulty=hard --count

# Check if a recipe exists
sbdb query --filter slug=pad-thai --exists

# Full-text search across markdown bodies
sbdb search "fish sauce"

# Get a single record with full content
sbdb get --id pad-thai
```

Available lookup suffixes: `__gte`, `__lte`, `__gt`, `__lt`, `__in`, `__contains`, `__icontains`, `__startswith`.

### Step 8: Update and delete

```bash
# Update a field
sbdb update --id pad-thai --field difficulty=hard

# Append to a list
sbdb update --id pad-thai --field 'tags+=spicy'

# Remove from a list
sbdb update --id pad-thai --field 'tags-=weeknight'

# Replace the markdown body
sbdb update --id pad-thai --content-file updated-pad-thai.md

# Soft delete (sets status field to "archived" if schema has one)
sbdb delete --id pad-thai --soft --yes

# Hard delete (removes .md + sidecar)
sbdb delete --id pad-thai --yes
```

### Step 9: Set up integrity verification

The integrity system ensures every file was last written by `sbdb`. Any hand-edit (or AI bypass) is detected.

```bash
# Generate an HMAC signing key (one-time setup)
sbdb doctor init-key

# Check for issues
sbdb doctor check

# Simulate a tamper: edit a file by hand
echo "TAMPERED" >> docs/recipes/pad-thai.md

# Doctor catches it
sbdb doctor check
# → exits non-zero, reports "content_sha mismatch" for pad-thai

# If the edit was intentional, re-sign it
sbdb doctor sign --force
# (or: sbdb doctor fix --recompute, which rewrites the sidecar
#  from current on-disk state without requiring an HMAC key)

# If it was accidental, revert it
git checkout docs/recipes/pad-thai.md
```

By default `doctor check` only audits files that differ from `HEAD` (modified, staged, untracked under any schema's `docs_dir`). Pass `--all` to walk the entire knowledge base. The premise: committed history was already verified, so re-scanning thousands of clean files on every invocation is wasteful — `--all` is for periodic full audits or recovery after an out-of-band edit lands in main.

Exit codes from `doctor check`:
- `0` — clean
- non-zero — drift detected; the JSON output enumerates per-doc causes (`content_sha mismatch`, `frontmatter_sha mismatch`, `record_sha mismatch`, `bad_sig`, `missing-sidecar`, `missing-md`).

### Step 10: Use multiple schemas in one project

A single project can have many schemas. Just add more YAML files:

```
schemas/
├── recipes.yaml
├── ingredients.yaml
└── meal-plans.yaml
```

Switch between them with `-s`:

```bash
sbdb list -s recipes
sbdb list -s ingredients
sbdb list -s meal-plans
```

Each schema has its own `docs_dir` and per-doc sidecars — they don't interfere with each other.

### Schema design reference

**Field type routing (automatic):**

| Field type | Stored in |
|---|---|
| `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `date`, `enum` | frontmatter |
| `list`, `object` | frontmatter |
| `virtual` (scalar return) | frontmatter (materialised on save) |
| `virtual` (complex return) | frontmatter |

All fields live in the markdown's YAML frontmatter. Queries walk `docs_dir` and read frontmatter directly — no separate index file in git. For very large knowledge bases an opt-in local cache may land in a future release; for now plan on this being concurrent file reads (acceptable up to ~10k docs).

**Virtual field patterns:**

```yaml
# Extract title from first heading
title:
  returns: string
  source: |
    def compute(content, fields):
        for line in content.splitlines():
            if line.startswith("# "):
                return line.removeprefix("# ").strip()
        return fields["slug"]

# Count words
word_count:
  returns: int
  source: |
    def compute(content, fields):
        return len(content.split())

# Extract ticket references
ticket_refs:
  returns: list[string]
  source: |
    def compute(content, fields):
        return re.findall("[A-Z]+-[0-9]+", content)

# Parse a structured marker from the body
status:
  returns: string
  source: |
    def compute(content, fields):
        for line in content.splitlines():
            if "**Status:**" in line:
                return line.split("**Status:**")[1].strip().lower()
        return "draft"
```

**All schema options:**

```yaml
version: 1                    # schema format version (always 1)
entity: <name>                # entity name, used in directory paths
docs_dir: <path>              # where .md files live (relative to project root)
filename: "{field}.md"        # filename template with {field} placeholders
id_field: <field>             # which field is the primary key (default: "id")
integrity: strict             # "strict", "warn", or "off"

# Deprecated (still parsed for v1 compatibility, ignored at runtime;
# the loader prints a stderr notice. Targeted for removal in v3):
# records_dir: <path>
# partition: none|monthly
# date_field: <field>
```

## Events

Events are not stored anywhere. They are projected from git history on demand by the `sbdb events emit` command, which walks commits in a range and emits one JSONL event per file change under a known schema's `docs_dir`. The repo's git log IS the event log — every commit produces zero or more events; nothing else is written.

The normative spec lives in [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-24-sbdb-events-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-24-sbdb-events-design.md). The summary:

```bash
sbdb events emit <commit-from> [<commit-to>|latest]
```

- `<commit-from>` accepts any git commit-ish (sha, branch, tag, `HEAD~N`, `@{1.week.ago}`).
- `<commit-to>` defaults to `HEAD`.
- Output is JSONL on stdout, suitable for piping.

### Wire format

```json
{"ts":"2026-04-26T14:32:01.000Z","type":"note.updated","id":"docs/notes/foo.md","sha":"<git-blob-hash>","prev":"<git-blob-hash>","op":"<commit-sha>","actor":"alice@example.com"}
```

- `ts` is the commit's author-date.
- `type` is `<bucket>.<verb>` — verbs are derived from git diff status (`A`/`C` → `created`, `M` → `updated`, `D` → `deleted`).
- `id` is the repo-relative POSIX path of the affected file.
- `sha` / `prev` are git blob hashes — workers resolve content directly with `git cat-file blob <sha>`.
- `op` is the commit hash, naturally grouping all events from one commit.
- `actor` is the commit author email.

There is no `data` field. There is no `[events]` config section. There is no `.sbdb/events/` directory.

### Examples

```bash
# Last week of events
sbdb events emit @{1.week.ago}

# Filter to a specific bucket
sbdb events emit HEAD~50 | jq 'select(.type == "note.created")'

# Pipe into a worker
sbdb events emit "$LAST_SEEN_COMMIT" | my-fanout-worker

# Replay any range, deterministically
sbdb events emit v1.0.0 v1.1.0
```

### Worker pattern

The cursor is the **commit hash**. Workers persist the most recent commit they processed and pass it back as `<commit-from>` next time. The projection is deterministic and fully replayable — re-running with the same range produces the identical stream.

There is no at-least-once / exactly-once concern at this layer because there is no delivery; the projection is a pull. Workers wanting exactly-once semantics key side-effects on `(op, id)` (commit + path) in their own idempotency table.

## How it works

- **Source of truth is the markdown file.** All scalar, complex, and virtual fields live in YAML frontmatter. Virtuals are computed from the body via sandboxed Starlark and materialised back into the frontmatter on every save.
- **Per-doc sidecars** (`<id>.yaml` next to `<id>.md`) hold integrity hashes and an optional HMAC signature. Two PRs adding two different docs touch disjoint files — git merges them without conflict, which makes parallel-PR / multi-agent workflows safe.
- **Queries** walk `docs_dir` and parse frontmatter directly. There is no aggregate index file committed to git; nothing is rewritten on every CRUD operation.
- **Doctor** verifies each `.md` against its sidecar. Default scope is working-tree changes only (committed history was already verified); `--all` does a full audit.
- **Events** are derived from git history on demand — the repo's git log IS the event log.

### Component dependency map

How the internal Go packages relate. Arrows mean "imports / depends on".

```

Key boundaries: `cmd/` is the only thing that talks to user input or stdout. `internal/document` orchestrates a single document's lifecycle (markdown + sidecar). `internal/events` holds the git-projection logic (no imports from other internal packages — it just shells out to `git log`). `internal/storage` (walker + markdown read/write) and `internal/integrity` (sidecar + GitScope) are leaf storage services. `internal/kg` is a derived SQLite cache; rebuildable, never committed.

### Write path: `sbdb create`

What happens when you run `sbdb create -s notes --input -`:

```
       ┌─────────────────────┐
       │   sbdb create       │
       │   (cmd/create.go)   │
       └──────────┬──────────┘

         └────────┬────────┘
                  │ 2. construct Document

              ┌────────┐
              │ stdout │
              └────────┘
```

Two file-system effects per save: the `<id>.md` and its sibling `<id>.yaml` sidecar (one rename-into-place each). No aggregate state to update — two PRs adding two different docs touch disjoint files and merge with zero git conflict. A failure at any step aborts cleanly with no partial state. No event is emitted on CRUD; events come from git history when you run `sbdb events emit` later, so the audit trail is whatever you've committed.

### Doctor flow

What `sbdb doctor check` and `sbdb doctor fix --recompute` do, in order:

```
        sbdb doctor check                       sbdb doctor fix --recompute
        ─────────────────                       ───────────────────────────
              │                                            │
              v                                            v

   │ uncommitted-only)    │                               v
   │ or walker (--all)    │                  ┌─────────────────────────┐
   └─────────┬────────────┘                  │ for each .md in scope:  │

             v                                │  recompute SHAs        │
   ┌──────────────────────┐                  │  rewrite <id>.yaml     │
   │ for each .md in     │                   │  (HMAC-sign if key      │
   │ scope:               │                  │   configured)           │
   │  load <id>.yaml      │                  └─────────────┬───────────┘
   │  recompute fm + body │                                │
   │  + record SHAs       │                                v
   │  compare; report     │                            Exit 0
   │  drift bits          │
   └─────────┬────────────┘
             v
       Exit:
       0 = clean
       1 = drift detected (per-doc causes in JSON output)
```

Default scope is the working-tree diff (modified + staged + untracked under any schema's `docs_dir`). `--all` audits everything. Outside a git repo, doctor falls back to `--all` with a stderr notice.

### Events: projection from git

`sbdb events emit` is the only event surface. There is no on-disk events log, no archive, no append path — events are computed from `git log` on demand and streamed as JSONL on stdout:

```
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  sbdb events emit <commit-from> [<commit-to>]    │
   └─────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                         │
                         │ shell out to:
                         │   git log --reverse --raw --no-renames \
                         │     --no-merges -z <from>..<to>
                         v
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │  parse NUL-delimited │
              │  token stream from   │
              │  git plumbing        │
              └──────────┬───────────┘
                         │
                         │  per commit, per changed file:
                         │   • status A/C → created
                         │   • status M   → updated
                         │   • status D   → deleted
                         │   • blob hashes from tree → sha / prev
                         │   • path matched against schemas' docs_dir → bucket
                         v
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │  build Event{ts,     │
              │   type, id, sha,     │
              │   prev, op, actor}   │
              └──────────┬───────────┘
                         │
                         │  one JSON line per event
                         v
                    ┌────────┐
                    │ stdout │
                    └────────┘
```

Files outside any schema's `docs_dir` are skipped. `op` is the commit hash, naturally grouping events from one commit. `actor` is the commit author email.

### Worker fan-out

How an external worker consumes events:

```
                  ┌──────────────────────────┐
                  │  GitHub / GitLab repo    │
                  │  (main branch)           │
                  └────────────┬─────────────┘
                               │  on push to main
                               v
                  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
                  │  Worker process                  │
                  │                                  │
                  │  • git pull                      │
                  │  • sbdb events emit "$LAST_SEEN" │
                  │  • for each JSON line on stdin:  │
                  │    ─ resolve content via         │
                  │      git cat-file blob <sha>     │
                  │    ─ persist last seen op        │
                  │      (commit hash) for next run  │
                  └──────┬─────────────┬─────────────┘
                         │             │
              ┌──────────┘             └──────────┐
              v                                   v
    ┌──────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────┐
    │  publish to SNS  │                │  publish to      │
    │  topic per type  │                │  Kafka topic     │
    └──────────────────┘                │  per bucket      │
                                        └──────────────────┘
              │                                   │
              v                                   v
    ┌──────────────────┐                ┌──────────────────┐
    │  Lambda / SQS    │                │  Stream          │
    │  consumers       │                │  processors      │
    │                  │                │                  │
    │  • notify Slack  │                │  • update search │
    │  • CRM webhook   │                │    index         │
    │  • email digest  │                │  • analytics     │
    └──────────────────┘                └──────────────────┘
```

The repo is the broker. The commit hash is the cursor. `git pull` is the subscription protocol. The projection is deterministic — re-running with the same `<from>..<to>` produces the byte-identical stream, so workers can replay history at any time.

## Compatibility

sbdb layers on top of existing markdown tools — it doesn't replace them. Your wiki/docs site keeps working exactly as before; sbdb adds typed schemas, integrity verification, a knowledge graph, and semantic search.

### How sbdb works alongside your tools

| Tool | Compatibility | How it integrates |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Obsidian** | Full | Same YAML frontmatter format. sbdb reads/writes frontmatter that Obsidian understands. `[[wikilinks]]` can be extracted as graph edges via virtual fields. Obsidian vault = sbdb knowledge base. |
| **VitePress** | Full | sbdb manages the `docs/` directory that VitePress serves. VitePress data loaders can iterate `<id>.md` frontmatter directly for dynamic tables. Crawl mode indexes all pages including index files with Vue components. |
| **Docusaurus** | Full | Same frontmatter convention. `.mdx` files indexed via crawl mode. Sidebars are independent of sbdb. |
| **Jekyll** | Full | Jekyll's YAML frontmatter IS sbdb's frontmatter — identical format. `_posts/` maps directly to a schema with monthly partitions. |
| **MkDocs** | Full | Standard markdown + optional YAML frontmatter. sbdb adds structure without changing what MkDocs reads. |
| **Hugo** | Partial | Hugo supports YAML frontmatter (default is TOML). Use `---` delimiters for YAML mode and sbdb works seamlessly. |
| **Notion** (exported) | Full | Export as markdown, then `sbdb index build --crawl` to index everything. No schema needed for crawl mode. |
| **Plain markdown** | Full | Any directory of `.md` files works with `sbdb index build --crawl`. No frontmatter required. |

### Integration patterns

**Pattern 1: Schema-managed entities** (structured data)

Best for: ADRs, meeting notes, incident reports — anything with a repeatable structure.

```bash
sbdb init                     # creates schemas/ + .sbdb.toml (bare scaffold)
sbdb create --input -         # create via CLI, writes .md + sidecar .yaml
sbdb query --filter ...       # fast structured queries
```

sbdb writes both the `<id>.md` and a sibling `<id>.yaml` sidecar with integrity hashes. Your wiki tool renders the `.md` files as pages; the sidecar is invisible to readers but visible in PR diffs.

**Pattern 2: Crawl mode** (unstructured content)

Best for: existing wikis, guides, architecture docs — content that doesn't follow a schema.

```bash
sbdb index build --crawl      # walks docs/, indexes everything
sbdb search "topic" --semantic # semantic search across all pages
sbdb graph export --export-format json  # knowledge graph from markdown links
```

No schema needed. sbdb extracts titles from `# headings`, entities from directory names, and edges from `[markdown](links.md)`.

**Pattern 3: Hybrid** (both together)

Use schemas for structured entities (notes, ADRs) and crawl mode for everything else. Both coexist in the same SQLite knowledge graph.

```bash
# Schema-backed
sbdb create -s notes --input -
sbdb query -s notes --filter status=active

# Crawl the rest
sbdb index build --crawl --docs-dir docs/

# Search across everything
sbdb search "deployment" --semantic
```

### What sbdb adds to your existing workflow

```
Your existing tool         sbdb adds
─────────────────         ─────────────
.md files              →  typed schemas + validation
YAML frontmatter       →  scalar/complex field routing + per-doc sidecar index
manual editing         →  integrity signing (SHA-256 + HMAC tamper detection)
file browsing          →  QuerySet with filters, ordering, pagination, streaming
Ctrl+F                 →  semantic search (embeddings + cosine similarity)
mental model           →  knowledge graph (auto-extracted from links + refs)
git log                →  projected on demand by `sbdb events emit` into a JSONL stream on stdout
parallel PRs           →  conflict-free merges (per-doc sidecars; no aggregate index)
```

## AI agent integration

Every command outputs structured JSON when piped or with `--format json`. Exit codes are stable (0=ok, 2=not found, 3=validation, 4=drift, 6=tamper). Designed as a CLI API for Claude Code and other AI agents.

The agent also gets a built-in audit channel: git history. After a commit, `sbdb events emit HEAD~1` enumerates exactly what changed in JSONL form — an agent that just edited `task.md` and committed doesn't need to diff the file, the projection tells it.

### Claude Code plugin

A plugin is available via the [bershadsky-claude-tools marketplace](https://github.com/sergio-bershadsky/ai). Install with: `/plugin marketplace add sergio-bershadsky/ai` then `/plugin install secondbrain-db`.

The plugin ships a PreToolUse guard that protects sbdb-managed repos from out-of-band AI edits:

- `guard-docs.py` — blocks Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit and Bash mutations targeting `docs/`. The AI must use `sbdb create / update / delete` instead.

The guard activates only when `.sbdb.toml` is present at the repo root. It prints install guidance if the `sbdb` CLI is missing.
